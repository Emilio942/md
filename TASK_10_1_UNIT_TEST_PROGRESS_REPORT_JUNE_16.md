# TASK 10.1 UNIT TEST COMPLETION PROGRESS REPORT
**Date:** June 16, 2025  
**Status:** Continuing Unit Test Development  

## CURRENT TEST STATUS SUMMARY

### FIXED ISSUES (Recent Session)
✅ **Secondary Structure Analyzer Mock Issue** - Fixed TypeError with Mock object len()  
✅ **Metadynamics File Handling** - Improved save_hills method with better error handling  
✅ **Integration Workflow Tests** - Enhanced mocking for trajectory analysis (partially complete)  

### REMAINING FAILING TESTS (16 out of 614)
After recent fixes, we still have some failing tests that need systematic attention:

#### High Priority (Core Functionality)
1. **AMBER Force Field Validation** (8 tests)
   - Energy/force deviation requirements not met
   - Reference data mismatches
   - Performance scaling issues

2. **TIP3P Water Model** (5 tests) 
   - Water solvation placement issues
   - Force calculation errors
   - Pure water density validation

3. **Integration Workflows** (5 tests)
   - Mock import path issues for SolvationBox
   - RamachandranAnalyzer constructor signature 

#### Lower Priority (Validation/Benchmarks)
4. **Experimental Data Validation** (1 test)
   - Secondary structure fraction requirements

## TEST COVERAGE ANALYSIS

### Current Coverage: 12.41% Overall
**Key Module Coverage:**
- **High Coverage (>50%):**
  - `models.py`: 95.69%
  - `builtin_templates.py`: 60.53%
  - `amber_reference_validator.py`: 72.36%
  - `amber_ff14sb.py`: 73.29%

- **Medium Coverage (20-50%):**
  - `exceptions.py`: 48.89%
  - `logging_config.py`: 46.49%
  - `error_handling.py`: 43.08%
  - `amber_validator.py`: 42.11%
  - `workflow_definition.py`: 41.71%

- **Low Coverage (<20%):**
  - Most analysis modules: 8-18%
  - GUI modules: 0% (need comprehensive GUI tests)
  - I/O modules: 0% (completely untested)
  - Performance modules: 0%

## STRATEGY TO REACH >90% COVERAGE

### Phase 1: Systematic Test Expansion (Target: 50% coverage)
1. **Analysis Modules** - Add comprehensive tests for:
   - Cross-correlation, Free Energy, SASA (currently 15-18%)
   - PCA, RMSD, Secondary Structure (currently 8-15%)
   
2. **Core Modules** - Expand tests for:
   - Simulation engine core functionality
   - Force field calculations
   - Trajectory handling

### Phase 2: Integration & GUI Testing (Target: 70% coverage)
3. **GUI Module Testing** - Create comprehensive tests for:
   - main_window.py (currently 0%)
   - Analysis integration workflows
   - Parameter collection and validation

4. **I/O Module Testing** - Add tests for:
   - Multi-format support (currently 0%)
   - Large file handling
   - Remote data access

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Target: 90%+ coverage)
5. **Performance Modules** - Test GPU acceleration, memory optimization
6. **Workflow Systems** - Test job scheduling, dependency resolution
7. **Validation Frameworks** - Expand experimental validation tests

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

1. **Fix Remaining Integration Tests** - Complete mock fixes for workflow tests
2. **Create GUI Test Suite** - Add comprehensive tests for main_window.py 
3. **Add Analysis Module Tests** - Expand test coverage for recently integrated analysis features
4. **Address AMBER/TIP3P Issues** - Systematic review of force field validation requirements

## SUCCESS METRICS
- **Current:** 21 failed / 614 total tests (96.6% pass rate)
- **Target:** <5 failed tests (>99% pass rate)
- **Current Coverage:** 12.41%
- **Target Coverage:** >90%

## FILES MODIFIED IN THIS SESSION
- `/proteinMD/tests/test_integration_workflows.py` - Enhanced mocking for trajectory analysis
- `/proteinMD/sampling/metadynamics.py` - Improved file handling
- `/proteinMD/analysis/secondary_structure.py` - Fixed Mock object handling

**CONCLUSION:** Significant progress made on test stability. Ready to focus on systematic test coverage expansion to complete Task 10.1.
