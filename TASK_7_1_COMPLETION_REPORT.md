# Task 7.1: Multi-Threading Support - Completion Report

## Overview
Task 7.1 has been successfully completed with comprehensive multi-threading support for molecular dynamics force calculations using OpenMP-style parallelization.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Core Multi-Threading Components

**ParallelForceCalculator Class** (`parallel_forces.py`)
- OpenMP-style parallelization using Numba's `@jit(parallel=True)` and `prange`
- Thread-safe force calculations with automatic load balancing
- Graceful fallback to threading for systems without Numba
- Performance benchmarking and validation capabilities

**Enhanced TIP3P Force Field** (`tip3p_forcefield.py`)
- Integrated parallel force calculations in both water-water and water-protein interactions
- Added `use_parallel` and `n_threads` parameters to force terms
- Seamless integration with existing `ForceTerm` architecture

### 2. Technical Implementation Details

**OpenMP Integration**
```python
@jit(nopython=True, parallel=True)
def calculate_forces_parallel(positions, forces):
