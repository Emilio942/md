## Quality Assurance Statistics

### Numerical Precision
All benchmarks were performed with appropriate numerical precision controls:
- Energy conservation: < 0.01% drift per nanosecond
- Temperature stability: ± 0.5 K standard deviation
- Pressure stability: ± 0.1 bar standard deviation

### Reproducibility Assessment
Multiple independent runs were performed for each benchmark to ensure statistical reliability:
- Minimum 3 runs per measurement
- Outlier detection using Chauvenet's criterion
- Standard error of the mean reported for all measurements

### Uncertainty Quantification
Total uncertainty includes:
1. **Random uncertainty**: Statistical error from multiple measurements
2. **Systematic uncertainty**: Estimated from methodology limitations
3. **Model uncertainty**: Differences in simulation algorithms

The combined uncertainty is calculated using standard error propagation methods and reported as 95% confidence intervals.
