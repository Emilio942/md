# GPU Acceleration Dependencies for proteinMD Task 7.2
# 
# This file lists the additional dependencies required for GPU acceleration.
# Install these packages for optimal performance on systems with compatible GPUs.

# Core GPU computing libraries
cupy-cuda11x>=10.0.0  # CUDA backend (adjust version based on CUDA installation)
# cupy-cuda12x>=11.0.0  # Alternative for CUDA 12.x
pyopencl>=2022.1      # OpenCL backend for broader GPU compatibility

# Optional dependencies for enhanced features
matplotlib>=3.5.0     # For performance visualization and plotting
numpy>=1.20.0         # Already required by base package
scipy>=1.7.0          # For advanced numerical operations

# Development and testing
pytest>=6.0.0         # For running GPU acceleration tests
pytest-benchmark>=3.4.0  # For performance benchmarking

# Installation instructions:
#
# For CUDA systems (NVIDIA GPUs):
#   pip install cupy-cuda11x  # or cupy-cuda12x for CUDA 12
#
# For OpenCL systems (AMD, Intel, some NVIDIA):
#   pip install pyopencl
#
# For full GPU acceleration support:
#   pip install -r gpu_requirements.txt
#
# Note: Ensure you have appropriate GPU drivers installed:
# - NVIDIA: CUDA toolkit and drivers
# - AMD: ROCm or OpenCL drivers
# - Intel: OpenCL runtime
