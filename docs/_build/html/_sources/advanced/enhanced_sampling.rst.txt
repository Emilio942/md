Enhanced Sampling Methods
========================

Introduction
============

Standard molecular dynamics simulations are often limited by the time scales accessible to current computational resources. Enhanced sampling methods overcome these limitations by modifying the sampling protocol to access rare events and compute thermodynamic properties more efficiently.

**Key Challenges in MD Sampling:**

- Energy barriers separate conformational states
- Rare events occur on time scales longer than accessible simulation time
- Conformational transitions may be slow compared to vibrational motion
- Standard MD provides poor sampling of high free energy regions

**Enhanced Sampling Strategies:**

1. **Temperature-based methods**: Use high temperature to overcome barriers
2. **Biased sampling**: Add potentials to enhance transitions
3. **Parallel methods**: Run multiple simulations simultaneously
4. **Reaction coordinate methods**: Focus sampling along specific pathways

Replica Exchange Methods
========================

Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics (REMD)
------------------------------------------

**Basic Principle:**

Run multiple replicas at different temperatures and periodically attempt to exchange configurations between adjacent temperature levels.

**Exchange Criterion:**

.. math::

   P_{i \leftrightarrow j} = \min\left(1, \exp\left[(\beta_i - \beta_j)(U_j - U_i)\right]\right)

**Algorithm:**

1. Run MD at each temperature for fixed time
2. Calculate exchange probability for adjacent pairs
3. Accept/reject exchange based on Metropolis criterion
4. Continue MD simulation at (possibly new) temperatures

**Temperature Selection:**

Optimal overlap requires acceptance ratio of 20-40%:

.. math::

   T_{i+1} = T_i \left(\frac{f+1}{f}\right)^{1/\sqrt{N_f}}

where f is target acceptance ratio and N_f is number of degrees of freedom.

**Benefits:**
- Overcomes kinetic trapping
- Enhanced conformational sampling
- Parallel implementation
- Can compute temperature-dependent properties

**Limitations:**
- Computational cost scales with number of replicas
- Limited to relatively small systems
- Requires overlap between temperature distributions

Hamiltonian Replica Exchange
---------------------------

**Concept:**

Exchange between different Hamiltonians rather than temperatures.

**Applications:**
- λ-dynamics for free energy calculations
- Different force field parameters
- Biased vs unbiased potentials

**Exchange Probability:**

.. math::

   P = \min\left(1, \exp\left[-\beta(U_j^{(i)} - U_i^{(i)} + U_i^{(j)} - U_j^{(j)})\right]\right)

Metadynamics
============

Basic Metadynamics
------------------

**Principle:**

Add history-dependent bias potential to discourage revisiting previously sampled regions of collective variable space.

**Bias Potential:**

.. math::

   V_G(\mathbf{s}, t) = \sum_{t'=\tau_G,2\tau_G,...}^{t'<t} w \exp\left(-\sum_{\alpha=1}^d \frac{(s_\alpha - s_\alpha(t'))^2}{2\sigma_\alpha^2}\right)

where:
- s(t) are collective variables
- w is Gaussian height
- σ_α is Gaussian width
- τ_G is deposition frequency

**Free Energy Recovery:**

In the long time limit:

.. math:

   F(\mathbf{s}) = -\lim_{t \to \infty} V_G(\mathbf{s}, t)

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Choose appropriate collective variables
2. Define Gaussian parameters (height, width, frequency)
3. Add bias during MD simulation
4. Monitor convergence of free energy profile

Well-Tempered Metadynamics
--------------------------

**Adaptive Gaussian Height:**

.. math::

   w(t) = w_0 \exp\left(-\frac{V_G(\mathbf{s}(t), t)}{k_B \Delta T}\right)

where ΔT is a bias temperature parameter.

**Benefits:**
- Faster convergence
- Better error estimates
- More stable long-time behavior
- Reduced overfilling of wells

Collective Variables
-------------------

**Requirements for Good CVs:**
- Distinguish between relevant metastable states
- Include slow degrees of freedom
- Be differentiable
- Have reasonable computational cost

**Common Collective Variables:**
- Distances and angles
- Coordination numbers
- Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD)
- Radius of gyration
- Secondary structure content

**Path Collective Variables:**

For complex transitions, use progress along predefined path:

.. math::

   s = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N i \exp(-\lambda |R - R_i|)}{\sum_{i=1}^N \exp(-\lambda |R - R_i|)}

.. math:

   z = -\frac{1}{\lambda} \ln\left(\sum_{i=1}^N \exp(-\lambda |R - R_i|)\right)

Umbrella Sampling
=================

Basic Theory
-----------

**Biasing Potential:**

Add harmonic restraints to sample specific regions of reaction coordinate:

.. math:

   w_i(\xi) = \frac{1}{2} k_i (\xi - \xi_i^{(0)})^2

**Biased Distribution:**

.. math:

   \rho_i(\xi) = \rho(\xi) \exp(-\beta w_i(\xi))

**WHAM Equations:**

Weighted Histogram Analysis Method recovers unbiased distribution:

.. math::

   \rho(\xi) = \frac{\sum_i N_i \rho_i(\xi)}{\sum_i N_i \exp(-\beta[F_i - w_i(\xi)])}

.. math:

   \exp(-\beta F_i) = \int d\xi \exp(-\beta w_i(\xi)) \rho(\xi)

**Implementation:**

1. Choose umbrella windows along reaction coordinate
2. Run independent simulations with harmonic restraints
3. Collect histograms from each window
4. Apply WHAM to obtain unbiased free energy profile

Adaptive Umbrella Sampling
--------------------------

**Adaptive Biasing Force (ABF):**

Continuously update bias to flatten free energy profile:

.. math:

   \frac{\partial A}{\partial \xi} = \left\langle \frac{\partial U}{\partial \xi} \right\rangle_{\xi}

**Benefits:**
- Single simulation instead of many windows
- Automatic adaptation to system
- Real-time free energy estimation

Thermodynamic Integration
========================

Free Energy Perturbation
------------------------

**Basic Equation:**

.. math:

   \Delta A = A_1 - A_0 = -k_B T \ln\left\langle \exp\left(-\beta[U_1 - U_0]\right)\right\rangle_0

**Limitations:**
- Requires overlap between initial and final states
- Poor convergence for large perturbations
- Exponential averaging causes numerical problems

**Bidirectional FEP:**

.. math:

   \Delta A = \Delta A_{0 \to 1} = -\Delta A_{1 \to 0}

Thermodynamic Integration (TI)
-----------------------------

**λ-Coupling:**

Introduce parameter λ to smoothly connect initial and final states:

.. math:

   U(\lambda) = (1-\lambda)U_0 + \lambda U_1

**TI Equation:**

.. math:

   \Delta A = \int_0^1 \left\langle \frac{\partial U(\lambda)}{\partial \lambda} \right\rangle_\lambda d\lambda

**Practical Implementation:**

1. Choose λ values (typically 10-20 points)
2. Run simulation at each λ value
3. Calculate ⟨∂U/∂λ⟩ at each point
4. Integrate numerically (trapezoid rule, Simpson's rule)

**Soft-Core Potentials:**

For particle insertion/deletion, use soft-core to avoid singularities:

.. math:

   U_{LJ}^{sc} = 4\epsilon\lambda^n \left[\frac{1}{(\alpha(1-\lambda)^m + (r/\sigma)^6)^2} - \frac{1}{\alpha(1-\lambda)^m + (r/\sigma)^6}\right]

Steered Molecular Dynamics
==========================

Constant Velocity SMD
---------------------

**External Force:**

Apply time-dependent force to pull system along reaction coordinate:

.. math:

   U_{SMD}(t) = \frac{1}{2}k(vt - \xi(t))^2

where v is pulling velocity and k is spring constant.

**Work Calculation:**

.. math:

   W = \int_0^t F_{ext}(t') \cdot \dot{\xi}(t') dt'

**Jarzynski Equality:**

.. math:

   \Delta A = -k_B T \ln\langle e^{-\beta W} \rangle

Constant Force SMD
------------------

**Application of Constant Force:**

.. math:

   F_{ext} = F_0 \hat{n}

where F_0 is constant force magnitude and n̂ is direction.

**Applications:**
- Protein unfolding studies
- Ligand unbinding pathways
- Mechanical properties of materials

Accelerated Molecular Dynamics
==============================

Hyperdynamics
-------------

**Boost Potential:**

Add potential in regions where no transition occurs:

.. math:

   U_{boost}(r) = \begin{cases}
   \frac{(E_b - U(r))^2}{\alpha + E_b - U(r)} & \text{if } U(r) < E_b \\
   0 & \text{if } U(r) \geq E_b
   \end{cases}

**Time Acceleration:**

.. math:

   t_{real} = \int_0^{t_{boost}} e^{\beta U_{boost}(r(t'))} dt'

**Benefits:**
- Accelerates rare events
- Preserves transition pathways
- Rigorously connects to real time

**Limitations:**
- Requires knowledge of energy barriers
- Limited to specific types of systems
- Complex implementation

Gaussian Accelerated MD (GaMD)
------------------------------

**Adaptive Boost Potential:**

.. math:

   \Delta U(r) = \begin{cases}
   \frac{1}{2}\frac{(E-U(r))^2}{V_{max} + E - U(r)} & \text{if } U(r) < E \\
   0 & \text{if } U(r) \geq E
   \end{cases}

**Benefits:**
- No predefined reaction coordinates
- Automatic parameter selection
- Enhanced sampling without bias
- Reweighting to recover canonical distribution

       recent_fes = fes_history[-time_window:]
       early_fes = fes_history[-2*time_window:-time_window]
       
       difference = np.mean(np.abs(recent_fes - early_fes))
       return difference < 0.1 * np.std(recent_fes)

Error Analysis
=============

Statistical Errors
------------------

**Block Analysis:**

Divide simulation into blocks and analyze block-to-block fluctuations:

.. math::

   \sigma_A^2 = \frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^N (A_i - \langle A \rangle)^2

**Bootstrap Resampling:**

Generate error estimates by resampling trajectory data:

.. code-block:: python

   def bootstrap_error(data, n_bootstrap=1000):
       """Estimate error using bootstrap resampling"""
       bootstrap_means = []
       n_data = len(data)
       
       for _ in range(n_bootstrap):
           sample = np.random.choice(data, size=n_data, replace=True)
           bootstrap_means.append(np.mean(sample))
       
       return np.std(bootstrap_means)
