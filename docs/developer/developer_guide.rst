About ProteinMD Development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ProteinMD is a modular, high-performance molecular dynamics simulation library designed for studying protein behavior in cellular environments. Our development philosophy emphasizes:

**Code Quality**
  - Clean, readable, and well-documented code
  - Comprehensive testing with >90% coverage
  - Performance optimization where needed
  - Consistent API design

**Collaboration**
  - Inclusive and welcoming community
  - Thorough code review process
  - Clear contribution guidelines
  - Open communication channels

**Scientific Rigor**
  - Physically accurate simulations
  - Validated algorithms and implementations
  - Reproducible results
  - Extensive benchmarking

Development Principles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Modularity**
  Our architecture is built around loosely coupled, highly cohesive modules that can be developed and tested independently.

**Performance**
  We prioritize computational efficiency while maintaining code clarity, with optional CUDA acceleration for computationally intensive operations.

**Extensibility**
  New force fields, analysis methods, and sampling techniques can be added through well-defined plugin interfaces.

**Reproducibility**
  All simulations are fully reproducible with deterministic random number generation and comprehensive logging.

Getting Help
-----------

**For Development Questions:**

- Create an issue on GitHub for bugs or feature requests
- Start a discussion for architectural questions
- Check existing documentation and code examples
- Ask in our developer community channels

**For Code Reviews:**

- Follow our pull request template
- Include comprehensive tests
- Document all public APIs
- Ensure CI passes before requesting review

**Emergency Contact:**

For security issues or urgent problems, contact the maintainers directly.

Development Environment
----------------------

**System Requirements:**
