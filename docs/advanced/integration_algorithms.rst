Integration Algorithms
===============================

Introduction
============

Numerical integration of Newton's equations of motion is the computational core of molecular dynamics simulations. The choice of integration algorithm affects both the accuracy and stability of simulations, making this a critical component of any MD implementation.

**Key Requirements for MD Integrators:**

1. **Numerical Stability**: Prevent exponential growth of errors
2. **Energy Conservation**: Minimize energy drift in microcanonical simulations
3. **Time Reversibility**: Enable detailed balance in statistical ensembles
4. **Computational Efficiency**: Allow reasonable time steps and fast evaluation
5. **Symplectic Properties**: Preserve phase space volume (Liouville's theorem)

The Finite Difference Approach
==============================

Starting Point: Newton's Equations
-----------------------------------

The fundamental equations we need to solve are:

.. math::

   \frac{d^2 r_i}{dt^2} = \frac{F_i(r)}{m_i}

where :math:`F_i(r) = -\nabla_i U(r)` are the forces derived from the potential energy.

**First-Order Differential Equation Form:**

.. math::

   \frac{dr_i}{dt} = v_i

.. math::

   \frac{dv_i}{dt} = \frac{F_i(r)}{m_i}

This transforms the second-order equation into a system of first-order equations.

Taylor Series Expansion
-----------------------

Most integration schemes are based on Taylor series expansions around the current time:

.. math::

   r(t + \Delta t) = r(t) + v(t)\Delta t + \frac{1}{2}a(t)\Delta t^2 + \frac{1}{6}\dot{a}(t)\Delta t^3 + O(\Delta t^4)

.. math::

   v(t + \Delta t) = v(t) + a(t)\Delta t + \frac{1}{2}\dot{a}(t)\Delta t^2 + O(\Delta t^3)

The accuracy of different schemes depends on how many terms are retained and how derivatives are approximated.

Simple Integration Schemes
==========================

Euler's Method
--------------

**Forward Euler:**

.. math::

   r(t + \Delta t) = r(t) + v(t)\Delta t

.. math::

   v(t + \Delta t) = v(t) + a(t)\Delta t

**Properties:**
- First-order accurate: O(Δt)
- Simple to implement
- Not time-reversible
- Poor energy conservation
- Rarely used in MD

**Modified Euler (Midpoint Method):**

.. math::

   v_{1/2} = v(t) + \frac{1}{2}a(t)\Delta t

.. math::

   r(t + \Delta t) = r(t) + v_{1/2}\Delta t

.. math::

   v(t + \Delta t) = v_{1/2} + \frac{1}{2}a(t + \Delta t)\Delta t

Better stability but still not suitable for long MD simulations.

Runge-Kutta Methods
-------------------

**Fourth-Order Runge-Kutta (RK4):**

.. math::

   k_1 = \Delta t \cdot f(t, y)

.. math::

   k_2 = \Delta t \cdot f(t + \Delta t/2, y + k_1/2)

.. math::

   k_3 = \Delta t \cdot f(t + \Delta t/2, y + k_2/2)

.. math::

   k_4 = \Delta t \cdot f(t + \Delta t, y + k_3)

.. math::

   y(t + \Delta t) = y(t) + \frac{1}{6}(k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4)

**Properties:**
- Fourth-order accurate: O(Δt⁴)
- Excellent for smooth problems
- Not symplectic (energy drift over long times)
- Computationally expensive (4 force evaluations per step)

The Verlet Algorithm Family
==========================

The Verlet algorithm and its variants are the most widely used integrators in molecular dynamics due to their excellent stability and conservation properties.

Basic Verlet Algorithm
----------------------

**Derivation:**

From Taylor expansion:

.. math::

   r(t + \Delta t) = r(t) + v(t)\Delta t + \frac{1}{2}a(t)\Delta t^2 + O(\Delta t^3)

.. math::

   r(t - \Delta t) = r(t) - v(t)\Delta t + \frac{1}{2}a(t)\Delta t^2 + O(\Delta t^3)

Adding these equations:

.. math::

   r(t + \Delta t) = 2r(t) - r(t - \Delta t) + a(t)\Delta t^2

**Velocity Calculation:**

.. math::

   v(t) = \frac{r(t + \Delta t) - r(t - \Delta t)}{2\Delta t}

**Properties:**
- Second-order accurate: O(Δt²)
- Time-reversible and symplectic
- Excellent energy conservation
- Requires storing positions at two time points
- Velocities calculated from positions (not evolved directly)

**Advantages:**
- Very stable for MD simulations
- Simple implementation
- Good conservation properties

**Disadvantages:**
- Velocities known only after position update
- Requires special startup procedure
- Numerical precision issues with velocity calculation

Velocity Verlet Algorithm
-------------------------

The velocity Verlet algorithm addresses some limitations of basic Verlet while maintaining its excellent properties.

**Algorithm:**

.. math::

   r(t + \Delta t) = r(t) + v(t)\Delta t + \frac{1}{2}a(t)\Delta t^2

.. math::

   v(t + \Delta t) = v(t) + \frac{1}{2}[a(t) + a(t + \Delta t)]\Delta t

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Calculate new positions: :math:`r(t + \Delta t) = r(t) + v(t)\Delta t + \frac{1}{2}a(t)\Delta t^2`
2. Calculate forces at new positions: :math:`F(t + \Delta t) = -\nabla U(r(t + \Delta t))`
3. Calculate new accelerations: :math:`a(t + \Delta t) = F(t + \Delta t)/m`
4. Update velocities: :math:`v(t + \Delta t) = v(t) + \frac{1}{2}[a(t) + a(t + \Delta t)]\Delta t`

**Properties:**
- Second-order accurate: O(Δt²)
- Time-reversible and symplectic
- Positions and velocities available simultaneously
- Only requires one force evaluation per step
- Self-starting (no special initialization)

**Code Example:**

.. code-block:: python

   def velocity_verlet_step(positions, velocities, forces, masses, dt):
       """Single step of velocity Verlet integration"""
       
       # Update positions
       new_positions = (positions + velocities * dt + 
                       0.5 * forces/masses * dt**2)
       
       # Calculate forces at new positions
       new_forces = calculate_forces(new_positions)
       
       # Update velocities
       new_velocities = (velocities + 
                        0.5 * (forces + new_forces)/masses * dt)
       
       return new_positions, new_velocities, new_forces

Leapfrog Algorithm
------------------

The leapfrog algorithm staggered the velocity and position updates in time, creating a very stable integration scheme.

**Staggered Updates:**

.. math::

   v(t + \Delta t/2) = v(t - \Delta t/2) + a(t)\Delta t

.. math::

   r(t + \Delta t) = r(t) + v(t + \Delta t/2)\Delta t

**Synchronization:**

When synchronized velocities are needed:

.. math::

   v(t) = \frac{1}{2}[v(t - \Delta t/2) + v(t + \Delta t/2)]

**Properties:**
- Second-order accurate: O(Δt²)
- Excellent stability and conservation
- Natural for some thermostats and barostats
- Velocities offset by Δt/2 from positions

**Equivalence to Velocity Verlet:**

The leapfrog and velocity Verlet algorithms are mathematically equivalent but differ in their implementation details and when quantities are available.

Advanced Integration Schemes
============================

Multiple Time Step Methods
---------------------------

Different interactions in molecular systems evolve on different time scales, motivating multiple time step (MTS) algorithms.

**r-RESPA (Reversible Reference System Propagator Algorithm):**

Separate fast (bonded) and slow (nonbonded) forces:

.. math::

   F_{total} = F_{fast} + F_{slow}

**Implementation:**

1. Update slow forces every n steps (large Δt)
2. Update fast forces every step (small δt)
3. Ensure time reversibility through operator splitting

**Time Scale Separation:**
- Fast: bond vibrations (~10 fs)
- Medium: angle bending (~100 fs)
- Slow: nonbonded interactions (~1 ps)

**Benefits:**
- Longer effective time steps
- Computational efficiency for large systems
- Must be carefully tuned to maintain stability

Constraint Algorithms
====================

Molecular systems often contain high-frequency vibrations (especially X-H bonds) that limit the time step. Constraint algorithms allow these degrees of freedom to be removed.

SHAKE Algorithm
---------------

SHAKE constrains bond lengths to fixed values using Lagrange multipliers.

**Constraint Equation:**

.. math::

   \sigma_k = r_k^2 - d_k^2 = 0

where :math:`d_k` is the constrained bond length.

**Iterative Solution:**

.. math::

   r_i^{(n+1)} = r_i^{(n)} + \sum_k \lambda_k^{(n)} \frac{\partial \sigma_k}{\partial r_i}

The Lagrange multipliers λₖ are determined iteratively to satisfy all constraints.

**Implementation:**

1. Perform unconstrained Verlet step
2. Iteratively adjust positions to satisfy constraints
3. Typically converges in 3-5 iterations

**Code Structure:**

.. code-block:: python

   def shake_constraints(positions, old_positions, constraints, tolerance=1e-6):
       """Apply SHAKE algorithm to satisfy distance constraints"""
       
       max_iterations = 100
       for iteration in range(max_iterations):
           max_deviation = 0.0
           
           for bond in constraints:
               i, j, target_distance = bond
               current_distance = distance(positions[i], positions[j])
               deviation = current_distance - target_distance
               
               if abs(deviation) > tolerance:
                   # Adjust positions to satisfy constraint
                   correction = calculate_shake_correction(...)
                   positions[i] += correction[i]
                   positions[j] += correction[j]
                   max_deviation = max(max_deviation, abs(deviation))
           
           if max_deviation < tolerance:
               break
       
       return positions

RATTLE Algorithm
----------------

RATTLE extends SHAKE to also constrain velocities, ensuring that constraints are maintained in both position and velocity.

**Velocity Constraints:**

.. math::

   \sum_i \frac{\partial \sigma_k}{\partial r_i} \cdot v_i = 0

This ensures that velocities are orthogonal to the constraint manifold.

**Two-Stage Process:**
1. SHAKE: Correct positions to satisfy constraints
2. RATTLE: Correct velocities to be consistent with constraints

**Benefits:**
- Allows time steps of 2-4 fs with hydrogen bonds constrained
- Better energy conservation than SHAKE alone
- Essential for NPT simulations with constraints

LINCS Algorithm
---------------

LINCS (Linear Constraint Solver) provides an alternative to SHAKE that is often more stable and efficient.

**Key Features:**
- Linear scaling with number of constraints
- Better parallelization properties
- More stable for highly constrained systems
- Standard in GROMACS package

**Matrix Formulation:**

LINCS solves the constraint problem using matrix operations rather than iterative corrections.

Symplectic Integrators
=====================

Symplectic integrators preserve the structure of Hamiltonian mechanics and are essential for long-time stability.

Hamilton's Equations
--------------------

.. math::

   \frac{dp_i}{dt} = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial q_i}

.. math::

   \frac{dq_i}{dt} = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_i}

**Symplectic Property:**

A transformation is symplectic if it preserves the symplectic 2-form:

.. math::

   \sum_i dp_i \wedge dq_i = \text{invariant}

**Consequences:**
- Phase space volume preservation (Liouville's theorem)
- Long-term stability of energy
- Correct statistical mechanics

Operator Splitting Methods
--------------------------

Many symplectic integrators are based on splitting the Hamiltonian:

.. math::

   H = T(p) + V(q)

where T is kinetic energy and V is potential energy.

**Strang Splitting:**

.. math::

   e^{\Delta t \mathcal{L}} \approx e^{\Delta t \mathcal{L}_V/2} e^{\Delta t \mathcal{L}_T} e^{\Delta t \mathcal{L}_V/2}

This gives the velocity Verlet algorithm, which is symplectic.

Higher-Order Symplectic Integrators
-----------------------------------

**Forest-Ruth Algorithm (4th order):**

More complex splitting schemes can achieve higher-order accuracy while remaining symplectic.

**Yoshida Construction:**

Systematic method for constructing higher-order symplectic integrators from lower-order ones.

**Trade-offs:**
- Higher accuracy per step
- More force evaluations per step
- Rarely used in practice due to computational cost

Integration in Different Ensembles
==================================

Microcanonical (NVE) Ensemble
-----------------------------

Standard Verlet-type integrators naturally sample the microcanonical ensemble where energy is conserved.

**Monitoring:**
- Total energy should be constant
- Energy drift indicates numerical problems
- Typical drift: <10⁻⁶ per time step

Canonical (NVT) Ensemble
------------------------

Temperature control requires modification of the equations of motion.

**Velocity Rescaling:**

Simple but non-physical approach:

.. math::

   v_i^{new} = v_i \sqrt{\frac{T_{target}}{T_{current}}}

**Nosé-Hoover Thermostat:**

Adds an extra degree of freedom with its own equation of motion:

.. math::

   \frac{dr_i}{dt} = \frac{p_i}{m_i}

.. math::

   \frac{dp_i}{dt} = F_i - \zeta p_i

.. math::`

   \frac{d\zeta}{dt} = \frac{1}{Q} \left( \sum_i \frac{p_i^2}{m_i} - N_f k_B T \right)

**Integration:**

Requires specialized integrators (e.g., Nosé-Hoover chains) to maintain symplectic properties.

Isothermal-Isobaric (NPT) Ensemble
----------------------------------

**Parrinello-Rahman Barostat:**

Allows both volume and shape fluctuations:

.. math::

   \frac{d\mathbf{h}}{dt} = \frac{\mathbf{p}_h}{W}

.. math::`

   \frac{d\mathbf{p}_h}{dt} = V(\mathbf{P} - p_0 \mathbf{I})

where **h** is the box matrix and **P** is the pressure tensor.

Time Step Selection
==================

Stability Criteria
------------------

**CFL Condition:**

The time step must be smaller than the characteristic time scale of the fastest motion:

.. math::

   \Delta t < \frac{2}{\omega_{max}}

where :math:`\omega_{max}` is the highest vibrational frequency.

**Practical Guidelines:**
- Without constraints: Δt ≤ 1 fs (limited by X-H vibrations)
- With SHAKE/RATTLE: Δt ≤ 2-4 fs
- Heavy atoms only: Δt ≤ 5-10 fs

Energy Conservation
-------------------

**Acceptable Energy Drift:**
- NVE simulations: <10⁻⁴ energy units per ns
- Monitor energy conservation as quality check
- Sudden energy changes indicate numerical problems

**Factors Affecting Stability:**
- System size (larger systems more sensitive)
- Temperature (higher T requires smaller Δt)
- Pressure coupling strength
- Constraint tolerance

Error Analysis
==============

Sources of Integration Error
---------------------------

**Truncation Error:**
- From finite-difference approximation
- Depends on integration scheme order
- Accumulates over time

**Round-off Error:**
- From finite machine precision
- More important for very long simulations
- Can be reduced with higher precision arithmetic

**Systematic Error:**
- From algorithm design choices
- May introduce statistical bias
- Important for free energy calculations

**Global vs. Local Error:**
- Local error: error in single step
- Global error: accumulated error over simulation
- Symplectic integrators have bounded global error

Validation and Testing
---------------------

**Energy Conservation Test:**

.. code-block:: python

   def test_energy_conservation(simulator, n_steps=10000):
       """Test energy conservation for NVE simulation"""
       initial_energy = simulator.calculate_total_energy()
       energies = []
       
       for step in range(n_steps):
           simulator.step()
           energies.append(simulator.calculate_total_energy())
       
       energy_drift = abs(energies[-1] - initial_energy) / initial_energy
       return energy_drift < 1e-4  # Acceptable drift threshold

**Time Reversibility Test:**

.. code-block:: python

   def test_time_reversibility(simulator, n_steps=1000):
       """Test time reversibility of integrator"""
       initial_state = simulator.get_state()
       
       # Forward integration
       for _ in range(n_steps):
           simulator.step()
       
       # Reverse velocities and integrate backward
       simulator.reverse_velocities()
       for _ in range(n_steps):
           simulator.step()
       
       final_state = simulator.get_state()
       return state_difference(initial_state, final_state) < tolerance
