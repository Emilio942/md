Overview
========

This section provides a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundations underlying molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Understanding these concepts is essential for proper interpretation of simulation results and selection of appropriate simulation parameters.

**Target Audience:**

* Graduate students new to MD simulations
* Researchers transitioning to computational methods
* Software developers implementing MD algorithms
* Experimentalists interpreting MD results

**Prerequisites:**

* Basic physics (mechanics, thermodynamics)
* Elementary statistical mechanics
* Calculus and linear algebra
* Basic programming concepts

Core Topics Covered
==================

**Mathematical Foundations**
   - Classical mechanics formulation
   - Newton's equations of motion
   - Hamiltonian and Lagrangian mechanics
   - Statistical mechanics principles

Organization
============

Each section builds upon previous concepts, starting with fundamental principles and progressing to advanced topics. Mathematical derivations are provided where helpful, with emphasis on physical intuition and practical implementation considerations.

The documentation includes:

- **Theoretical derivations** with step-by-step explanations
- **Practical examples** using ProteinMD
- **Best practice recommendations** for different system types
- **Common pitfalls** and how to avoid them
- **Literature references** for deeper study

**Navigation Tips:**

* Use the table of contents to jump to specific topics
* Mathematical equations are numbered for easy reference
* Code examples can be copied and modified for your use
* Cross-references link related concepts throughout the documentation

Getting Started
===============

For newcomers to MD simulation, we recommend starting with :doc:`md_fundamentals` to establish the basic framework, then proceeding to :doc:`force_fields` to understand how molecular interactions are modeled.

Experienced users may want to focus on specific topics like :doc:`enhanced_sampling` or :doc:`best_practices` for their particular research needs.
