Molecular Dynamics Fundamentals
=====================================

Introduction
============

Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation is a computational method that predicts the time evolution of a system of interacting particles by solving Newton's equations of motion. This technique allows us to study the dynamics and thermodynamic properties of molecular systems at atomic resolution.

Classical Mechanics Foundation
==============================

Newton's Equations of Motion
-----------------------------

The fundamental equation governing MD simulations is Newton's second law:

.. math::

   F_i = m_i \frac{d^2 r_i}{dt^2} = m_i a_i

where:
- :math:`F_i` is the force on atom :math:`i`
- :math:`m_i` is the mass of atom :math:`i`
- :math:`r_i` is the position vector of atom :math:`i`
- :math:`a_i` is the acceleration of atom :math:`i`

**Force Calculation**

Forces are derived from the potential energy function:

.. math::

   F_i = -\nabla_i U(r_1, r_2, ..., r_N)

where :math:`U` is the total potential energy of the system.

**Integration in Time**

The equations of motion are integrated numerically using finite difference methods. The most common approach is the Verlet algorithm:

.. math::

   r_i(t + \Delta t) = 2r_i(t) - r_i(t - \Delta t) + \frac{F_i(t)}{m_i} \Delta t^2

Hamiltonian Mechanics
---------------------

The Hamiltonian formulation provides an alternative perspective that is particularly useful for understanding conservation laws and developing advanced algorithms.

**Hamiltonian Function**

.. math::

   H(p, q) = \sum_i \frac{p_i^2}{2m_i} + U(q_1, q_2, ..., q_N)

where :math:`p_i` are the momenta and :math:`q_i` are the generalized coordinates.

**Hamilton's Equations**

.. math::

   \frac{dq_i}{dt} = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_i} = \frac{p_i}{m_i}

.. math::

   \frac{dp_i}{dt} = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial q_i} = -\frac{\partial U}{\partial q_i}

**Conservation Laws**

In an isolated system (no external forces), the total energy is conserved:

.. math::

   E_{total} = E_{kinetic} + E_{potential} = \text{constant}

This conservation law serves as an important check for simulation accuracy.

The Born-Oppenheimer Approximation
===================================

MD simulations typically treat only nuclear motion explicitly, while electronic degrees of freedom are averaged out. This is justified by the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, which exploits the large mass difference between nuclei and electrons.

**Assumptions:**

1. Electronic motion is much faster than nuclear motion
2. Electrons instantaneously adjust to nuclear configurations
3. The potential energy surface is determined by nuclear positions only

**Implications:**

- Potential energy functions depend only on nuclear coordinates
- Chemical bonds are treated as classical springs
- Electronic excitations are not explicitly modeled

Ergodic Hypothesis
==================

The ergodic hypothesis is crucial for connecting MD simulations to experimental observables. It states that time averages equal ensemble averages for sufficiently long simulations.

**Mathematical Statement**

.. math::

   \langle A \rangle_{time} = \lim_{T \to \infty} \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T A(r(t), p(t)) dt = \langle A \rangle_{ensemble}

where :math:`A` is any observable quantity.

**Practical Implications:**

- Simulations must be long enough to sample the relevant phase space
- Initial conditions should not bias the results
- System must be able to explore all accessible states

Time and Length Scales
=======================

Understanding the time and length scales accessible to MD simulation is essential for proper experimental design.

**Typical Time Scales:**

- Bond vibrations: 10-100 fs
- Angle bending: 100-1000 fs  
- Protein side chain rotation: 1-100 ps
- Loop movements: 100 ps - 1 ns
- Domain motions: 1-100 ns
- Protein folding: μs - ms

**Typical Length Scales:**

- Bond lengths: 1-2 Å
- Small molecules: 5-10 Å
- Protein secondary structure: 10-20 Å
- Protein domains: 20-50 Å
- Complete proteins: 50-200 Å

**Simulation Limitations:**

Current MD simulations can routinely access:
- Time scales: fs to μs (occasionally ms)
- System sizes: 10³ to 10⁶ atoms
- Spatial resolution: atomic (sub-Å)

Periodic Boundary Conditions
============================

To simulate bulk properties with finite computational resources, periodic boundary conditions (PBC) are employed.

**Implementation:**

The simulation box is replicated infinitely in all directions. When a particle exits one side of the box, its image enters from the opposite side.

**Minimum Image Convention:**

For each pair of particles, only the nearest image is considered for force calculations:

.. math::

   r_{ij}^{min} = r_{ij} - \text{round}(r_{ij}/L) \times L

where :math:`L` is the box length and round() rounds to the nearest integer.

**Considerations:**

- Box size must be large enough to avoid self-interactions
- Long-range interactions require special treatment (Ewald summation)
- Some properties (e.g., surface tension) cannot be studied with PBC

Temperature and Pressure Control
================================

Real experiments are typically performed under controlled temperature and pressure conditions, requiring special algorithms in MD simulations.

**Temperature Control (Thermostats)**

Temperature is related to the average kinetic energy:

.. math::

   \frac{1}{2} k_B T = \frac{1}{3N} \sum_i \frac{1}{2} m_i v_i^2

Common thermostat methods:
- Velocity rescaling (Berendsen)
- Nosé-Hoover thermostat
- Langevin dynamics

**Pressure Control (Barostats)**

Pressure is controlled by allowing the simulation box to change size. The instantaneous pressure is calculated from the virial theorem:

.. math::

   P = \frac{N k_B T}{V} + \frac{1}{3V} \sum_i \vec{r_i} \cdot \vec{F_i}

Common barostat methods:
- Berendsen barostat
- Parrinello-Rahman barostat
- Monte Carlo barostat

Simulation Workflow
===================

A typical MD simulation follows these steps:

**1. System Preparation**
   - Build initial molecular structure
   - Add solvent molecules if needed
   - Assign force field parameters
   - Set initial velocities from Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution

**2. Energy Minimization**
   - Remove steric clashes
   - Optimize initial geometry
   - Prepare system for dynamics

**3. Equilibration**
   - Gradually heat system to target temperature
   - Allow pressure to equilibrate
   - Equilibrate solvent around solute

**4. Production Run**
   - Collect data for analysis
   - Monitor energy conservation
   - Save trajectory for analysis

**5. Analysis**
   - Calculate structural properties
   - Compute thermodynamic quantities
   - Analyze dynamical behavior

Example: Simple MD Algorithm
============================

Here's a simplified MD algorithm outline:

.. code-block:: python

   def md_simulation(positions, velocities, forces, dt, n_steps):
       """
       Basic MD simulation using Verlet integration
       """
       for step in range(n_steps):
           # Calculate forces from current positions
           forces = calculate_forces(positions)
           
           # Update positions (Verlet integration)
           new_positions = (2 * positions - prev_positions + 
                           forces/masses * dt**2)
           
           # Update velocities
           velocities = (new_positions - prev_positions) / (2 * dt)
           
           # Apply temperature/pressure control if needed
           velocities = apply_thermostat(velocities, target_temp)
           positions = apply_barostat(positions, target_pressure)
           
           # Save trajectory data
           save_frame(positions, velocities, forces)
           
           # Update for next step
           prev_positions = positions
           positions = new_positions

       return trajectory

**Key Considerations:**

- Time step must be small enough for numerical stability
- Force calculations dominate computational cost
- Conservation laws should be monitored
- Statistical quantities require averaging over many configurations

- Correlation functions
- Relaxation times
- Transport properties

**Thermodynamic Properties:**
