**Breaking Changes**

Since this is the initial release, there are no breaking changes from previous versions.

**New Features**

*Simulation Engine*

.. code-block:: python

   # New MDSimulation class with comprehensive features
   from proteinmd import MDSimulation, VelocityVerletIntegrator
   from proteinmd.core import LangevinThermostat, BerendsenBarostat
   
   simulation = MDSimulation(
       system=system,
       integrator=VelocityVerletIntegrator(timestep=0.002),
       thermostat=LangevinThermostat(temperature=300.0),
       barostat=BerendsenBarostat(pressure=1.0)
   )

*Analysis Pipeline*

.. code-block:: python

   # New analysis pipeline system
   from proteinmd.analysis import AnalysisPipeline, RMSD, RMSF
   
   pipeline = AnalysisPipeline()
   pipeline.add_analysis(RMSD(reference_frame=0))
   pipeline.add_analysis(RMSF(selection="protein"))
   results = pipeline.run(trajectory)

*Command-Line Interface*

.. code-block:: bash

   # New CLI commands
   proteinmd run config.yaml          # Run simulation
   proteinmd analyze trajectory.dcd   # Run analysis
   proteinmd setup protein.pdb        # Setup system

**Performance Improvements**
