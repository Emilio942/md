# MEMORY OPTIMIZATION GUIDE FOR MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS

## Common Memory Leak Patterns and Fixes

### 1. Unbounded List Growth
❌ **Problem:**
```python
self.trajectories = []
self.energies = []
# These lists grow indefinitely during simulation
```

✅ **Solution:**
```python
from collections import deque
self.trajectories = deque(maxlen=1000)  # Keep only last 1000 frames
self.energies = deque(maxlen=5000)      # Keep only last 5000 energy values
```

### 2. Matplotlib Object Leaks
❌ **Problem:**
```python
ax.collections.clear()  # Doesn't properly remove objects
quiver.remove()         # May fail silently
```

✅ **Solution:**
```python
# Proper cleanup of matplotlib collections
for collection in ax.collections[:]:
    try:
        collection.remove()
    except:
        pass
ax.collections.clear()

# Safe object removal
try:
    quiver.remove()
except:
    pass
```

### 3. Large Array Allocations
❌ **Problem:**
```python
field_grid = np.zeros((100, 100, 100))  # Large arrays created repeatedly
```

✅ **Solution:**
```python
# Pre-allocate and reuse buffers
if not hasattr(self, '_field_buffer'):
    self._field_buffer = np.zeros((50, 50, 50))  # Smaller, reusable buffer
```

### 4. Missing Garbage Collection
❌ **Problem:**
```python
for step in range(10000):
    simulate_step()  # No memory management
```

✅ **Solution:**
```python
for step in range(10000):
    simulate_step()
    if step % 1000 == 0:
        import gc
        gc.collect()  # Periodic cleanup
```

## Memory-Efficient Simulation Design

### Use Bounded Storage
- Limit trajectory history to reasonable lengths (1000-5000 frames)
- Use deque with maxlen for automatic size management
- Store only essential data for analysis

### Optimize Neighbor Lists
- Update neighbor lists only when necessary (every 10-20 steps)
- Use cutoff distances to limit calculations
- Pre-allocate neighbor list storage

### Manage Visualization Objects
- Clean up matplotlib objects after each frame
- Close figures when done with animations
- Use plt.ioff() for non-interactive plots

### Monitor Memory Usage
- Use the MemoryProfiler class for continuous monitoring
- Set memory growth thresholds (< 1-2 MB/min for stable simulations)
- Profile long-running simulations regularly

## Validation Checklist

✅ Simulation runs 10,000+ steps with constant memory usage
✅ No continuous memory growth over 30+ minutes
✅ Memory profiling shows growth rate < 1 MB/min
✅ Matplotlib animations don't accumulate objects
✅ Trajectory storage is bounded and efficient

## Tools and Scripts

- `memory_profiler.py` - Real-time memory monitoring
- `optimized_simulation.py` - Memory-optimized MD simulation class
- `test_memory_leaks.py` - Comprehensive memory leak testing
- `fix_memory_leaks.py` - Automated fixing of common patterns

## Performance Tips

1. Use numpy operations instead of Python loops
2. Pre-allocate arrays when possible
3. Limit visualization resolution for real-time displays
4. Use appropriate data types (float32 vs float64)
5. Implement lazy evaluation for expensive calculations

Remember: A well-optimized simulation should maintain constant memory usage
regardless of simulation length!
