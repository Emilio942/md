Introduction
This project is designed to simulate the behavior of two interacting particles in a 3D space. It provides a straightforward approach to understanding fundamental concepts such as Newton's laws of motion, gravitational forces, and potential energy interactions. The simulation is implemented in Python, leveraging libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib for efficient computation and visualization.

Features
Simulate the dynamics of two particles in a 3D space.
Visualize the trajectory and interactions of the particles over time.
Customize initial conditions including position, velocity, and mass of each particle.
Apply different force models (e.g., gravitational, electrostatic).
Export simulation data for further analysis.
Usage
You can run the simulation script with default or custom parameters. Simply download the script and execute it with Python.



Examples
Here are a few examples of how you can use the simulation:

Basic Gravitational Interaction:

Simulate two particles under gravitational attraction.
Initial conditions: Particle 1 (mass=5kg, position=(0,0,0), velocity=(0,1,0) m/s), Particle 2 (mass=10kg, position=(1,1,1), velocity=(-1,0,0) m/s).
Electrostatic Forces:

Modify the force model to simulate electrostatic interactions between two charged particles.
Custom Scenarios:

Define your own initial conditions and force models to explore different physical scenarios.
Each example can be visualized using the built-in plotting functions.
