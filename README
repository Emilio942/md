## Introduction

This project is designed to simulate the behavior of two interacting particles in a **3D space**. It helps in understanding fundamental concepts like Newton's laws of motion, gravitational forces, and potential energy interactions. The simulation is implemented in Python using **NumPy** and **Matplotlib** for efficient computation and visualization.

## Features

- **3D Particle Dynamics**: Simulate the motion of two particles in a 3D environment.
- **Trajectory Visualization**: Track and visualize the paths and interactions of the particles over time.
- **Custom Initial Conditions**: Set initial positions, velocities, and masses for each particle.
- **Force Models**: Choose from different interaction models (e.g., gravitational, electrostatic).
- **Data Export**: Export simulation results for further analysis.

## Usage

To run the simulation script with default or custom parameters, use the following commands:

```bash
# Run the simulation with default settings
python simulate.py

# Run the simulation with custom parameters
python simulate.py --mass1 5 --mass2 10 --pos1 0,0,0 --pos2 1,1,1 --vel1 0,1,0 --vel2 -1,0,0
